# Hola, soy Maira üëã

![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/mairagee524) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/followers/mairagee524?label=Followers"/>

I am a bilingual software engineer who is passionate about solving problems. As a graduate from UCLA Extension's Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, I was able to build three applications for local businesses in order for them to keep providing services to their clients. It is due to that experience that I am passionate about giving back to communities. I currently work at Entidad as a Platform Engineering Apprentice, volunteer at a start-up called Go-Off! as a full-stack engineer, and work part-time as a teaching assistant for my former bootcamp, Trilogy/2U!


### üå± Things I am currently working on: 
- Building a film application at my internship, DataSlate
- Making buttons for the Go-Off! application
- Landing my first job in tech as a software engineer
- Finding open-source projects I can contribute to


### :muscle: Things I am challenging myself with:
- Learning Postgres
- Reading a book a month
- Working out at least 3 times per week
- Cooking more from home than ordering takeout

- Mentorship/assistance needed
